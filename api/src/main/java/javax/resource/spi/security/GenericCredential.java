/** The interface <code>javax.resource.spi.security.GenericCredential</code> 
 *  defines a security mechanism independent interface for accessing 
 *  security credential of a resource principal. 
 *
 *  <p>The <code>GenericCredential</code> interface provides a Java 
 *  wrapper over an underlying mechanism specific representation of
 *  a security credential. For example, the <code>GenericCredential</code>
 *  interface can be used to wrap Kerberos credentials.
 *
 *  <p>The connector architecture does not define any standard format 
 *  and requirements for security mechanism specific credentials. For 
 *  example, a security credential wrapped by a GenericCredential 
 *  interface can have a native representation specific to an operating 
 *  system.
 *
 *  <p>The GenericCredential interface enables a resource adapter to 
 *  extract information about a security credential. The resource adapter
 *  can then manage EIS sign-on for a resource principal by either:
 *  <UL>
 *    <LI>using the credentials in an EIS specific manner if the underlying
 *        EIS supports the security mechanism type represented by the 
 *        GenericCredential instance, or,
 *    <LI>using GSS-API if the resource adapter and underlying EIS 
 *        instance support GSS-API.
 *  </UL>
