/** <p>The ConnectionRequestInfo interface enables a resource adapter to 
 *  pass its own request specific data structure across the connection
 *  request flow. A resource adapter extends the empty interface to
 *  supports its own data structures for connection request.
 *  
 *  <p>A typical use allows a resource adapter to handle 
 *  application component specified per-connection request properties
 *  (example - client ID, language). The application server passes these 
 *  properties back across to match/createManagedConnection calls on 
 *  the resource adapter. These properties remain opaque to the 
 *  application server during the connection request flow. 
 *
 *  <p>Once the ConnectionRequestInfo reaches match/createManagedConnection
 *  methods on the ManagedConnectionFactory instance, resource adapter
 *  uses this additional per-request information to do connection 
 *  creation and matching.
