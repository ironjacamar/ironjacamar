/**
 * A standard {@link WorkContext WorkContext} that allows a {@link Work
 * Work} instance to propagate security related context information from an EIS
 * to an application server.
 * <p>
 * 
 * 
 * This allows an EIS/resource adapter to flow-in security context information
 * and execute a Work instance, and call methods on a MessageEndpoint interface,
 * to effect message inflow, within that Work instance, in the context of an
 * established identity.
 * <p>
 * 
 * 
 * A resource adapter indicates to the WorkManager, that a Work instance needs
 * to be run in a specified security execution context by submitting a Work
 * instance that implements WorkContextProvider interface and ensuring that
 * the List of WorkContexts for that Work instance contains an instance of its
 * subclass of SecurityContext.
 * <p>
 * 
 * 
 * It should be noted however that when a resource adapter flows-in an identity
 * to be used by the application server, the propagated identity may or may not
 * belong to the application server's security domain.
 * <p>
 * 
 * 
 * There are therefore, two scenarios while a resource adapter propagates a
 * security identity from an EIS to the application server:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Case 1: Resource adapter flows-in an identity in the application server's
 * security domain: In this case, the application server could just set the
 * initiating principal, flown-in from the resource adapter, as the security
 * context the Work instance executes as.</li>
 * <li>Case 2: Resource adapter flows-in an identity belonging to the EIS'
 * security domain: The resource adapter establishes a connection to the EIS and
 * needs to perform a Work in the context of an EIS identity. In this case, the
 * initiating or caller principal does not exist in the application server's
 * security domain and a translation from one domain to the other needs to be
 * performed.</li>
 * </ul>

    * The handler argument must not be null, and the argument handler and the
    * <code>CallbackHandler</code> passed to this method must support the
    * following <code>Callback</code>s defined in JSR 196: Java Authentication
    * SPI for Containers specification:
    * <p>
    * <ul>
    * <li>CallerPrincipalCallback</li>
    * <li>GroupPrincipalCallback</li>
    * <li>PasswordValidationCallback</li>

    * <ul>
    * <li>CertStoreCallback</li>
    * <li>PrivateKeyCallback</li>
    * <li>SecretKeyCallback</li>
    * <li>TrustStoreCallback</li>
    * </ul>
    * <p>
    * 
    * A resource adapter might use the <code>CallerPrincipalCallback</code> “to
    * set the container's representation of the caller principal. The
    * CallbackHandler must establish the argument Principal as the caller
    * principal associated with the invocation being processed by the
    * container. When the argument Principal is null, the handler will
    * establish the container's representation of the unauthenticated caller
    * principal.”
    * <p>
    * 
    * A resource adapter might use the <code>GroupPrincipalCallback</code> “to
    * establish the container's representation of the corresponding group
    * principals within the Subject. When a null value is passed to the groups
    * argument, the handler will establish the container's representation of no
    * group principals within the Subject. Otherwise, the handler's processing
    * of this callback is additive, yielding the union (without duplicates) of
    * the principals existing within the Subject, and those created with the
    * names occuring within the argument array. The CallbackHandler will define
    * the type of the created principals.”
    * <p>
    * 
    * A resource adapter might use the <code>PasswordValidationCallback</code>
    * “to employ the password validation facilities of its containing runtime.”
    * <p>
    * 
    * The executionSubject argument must be non-null and it must not be
    * read-only. It is expected that this method will populate this
    * executionSubject with principals and credentials that would be flown into
    * the application server.
    * <p>
    * 
    * The serviceSubject argument may be null. If it is not null, it must not be read-
    * only. It represents the application server’s credentials and it may be used by the
    * Work implementation to retrieve Principals and credentials necessary to establish
    * a connection to the EIS (in the cause of mutual-auth like scenarios). The
    * serviceSubject may contain the credentials of the application server or the
    * SecurityContext implementation may collect the service credentials, as
    * necessary, by using the CallbackHandler passed to it.
    * <p>
    * 
    * 
    * When this method is called, the method implementation
    * <ul>
    * <li>identifies the security context that needs to be flown-in to the
    * application server to serve as the execution context of the Work
    * instance.</li>
    * <li>populates the executionSubject with the EIS Principals and
    * Credentials that it wants to serve as the security context for the Work
    * instance to be executed in.</li>
    * <li>adds instances of the necessary Callbacks , usually a subset of the
    * ones listed above, to an array and invokes the handle() method in the
    * container's CallbackHandler implementation passing in the array of
    * Callback instances.</li>
    * <li>on sucessful return from the CallbackHandler.handle() method the
    * setSecurityContext returns after ensuring that the executionSubject is
    * populated with the valid Principals and Credentials that represent the
    * execution context of the Work instance</li>
