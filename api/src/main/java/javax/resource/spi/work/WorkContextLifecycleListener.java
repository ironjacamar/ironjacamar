/**
 * This class models the various events that occur during the processing of the
 * <code>WorkContext</code>s associated with a <code>Work</code>
 * instance. This interface may be implemented by a <code>WorkContext</code>
 * instance to receive notifications from the <code>WorkManager</code> when
 * the <code>WorkContext</code> is set as the execution context of the
 * <code>Work</code> instance it is associated with.
 * <p>
 * 
 * When a <code>WorkManager</code> sets up the execution context of a
 * <code>Work</code> instance that implements
 * <code>WorkContextProvider</code>, the <code>WorkManager</code> must
 * make the relevant lifecycle notifications if an <code>WorkContext</code>
 * instance implements this interface.
 * <p>
 * 
 * When a <code>Work</code> instance is submitted to the Connector
 * <code>WorkManager</code> using one of the methods that passes in a
 * <code>WorkListener</code> as a parameter, the <code>WorkManager</code>
 * must send <code>Work</code> related notifications to the
 * <code>WorkListener</code> and <code>WorkContext</code> setup related
 * notifications to this interface.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The possible error conditions that might occur during associating an
 * <code>WorkContext</code> with a <code>Work</code> instance is captured
 * in {@link WorkContextErrorCodes}.
 * <p>
