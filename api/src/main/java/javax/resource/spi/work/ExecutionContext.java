/**
 * This class models an execution context (transaction, security, etc) 
 * with which the <code>Work</code> instance must be executed.  
 * This class is provided as a convenience for easily creating 
 * <code>ExecutionContext</code> instances by extending this class
 * and overriding only those methods of interest.
 *
 * <p>Some reasons why it is better for <code>ExecutionContext</code> 
 * to be a class rather than an interface: 
 * <ul><li>There is no need for a resource adapter to implement this class. 
 * It only needs to implement the context information like 
 * transaction, etc.
 * <li>The resource adapter code does not have to change when the 
 * <code>ExecutionContext</code> class evolves. For example, more context 
 * types could be added to the <code>ExecutionContext</code> class 
 * (in the future) without forcing resource adapter implementations 
 * to change.</ul>
 *
 * Note: Resource adapters that are developed for Connectors 1.6 specification
 * compliant application servers and above, are recommended to use
 * the <code>TransactionWorkContext</code> interface instead of this 
 * class. See Chapter.11 Generic Work Context in the Connectors 1.6
 * specification for more details.
