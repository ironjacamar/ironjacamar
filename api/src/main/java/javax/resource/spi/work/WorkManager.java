/**
 * This interface models a <code>WorkManager</code> which provides a facility
 * to submit <code>Work</code> instances for execution. This frees the user
 * from having to create Java threads directly to do work. Further, this
 * allows efficient pooling of thread resources and more control over thread
 * usage.
 *
 * The various stages in <code>Work</code> processing are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> work submit: A <code>Work</code> instance is being submitted for 
 * execution. The <code>Work</code> instance could either be accepted or 
 * rejected with a <code>WorkRejectedException</code> set to an appropriate
 * error code. </li>
 *
 * <li> work accepted: The submitted <code>Work</code> instance has been 
 * accepted. The accepted <code>Work</code> instance could either start 
 * execution or could be rejected again with a 
 * <code>WorkRejectedException</code> set to an appropriate error code.
 * There is no guarantee on when the  execution would start unless a start 
 * timeout duration is specified. When a start timeout is specified, the 
 * <code>Work</code> execution must be started within the specified  
 * duration (not a  real-time guarantee), failing which a 
 * <code>WorkRejectedException</code> set to an error code 
 * (<code>WorkRejected.TIMED_OUT</code>) is thrown. </li>
 *
 * <li> work rejected: The <code>Work</code> instance has  been rejected. 
 * The <code>Work</code> instance could be rejected during <code>Work</code>
 * submittal  or after the <code>Work</code> instance has been accepted 
 * (but before Work instance starts execution). The rejection could be due 
 * to internal factors or start timeout expiration. A 
 * <code>WorkRejectedException</code> with an appropriate error code 
 * (indicates the reason) is thrown in both cases. </li>
 *
 * <li> work started: The execution of the <code>Work</code> 
 * instance has started. This means that a thread
 * has been allocated for its execution. But this  
 * does not guarantee that the allocated thread has been scheduled to run 
 * on a CPU resource. Once execution is started, the allocated thread 
 * sets up an appropriate execution context (transaction , security, etc)
 * and calls Work.run(). Note, any exception thrown during execution context
 * setup or Work.run() leads to completion of processing. </li>
 *
 * <li> work completed: The execution of the <code>Work</code> has been 
 * completed. The execution could complete with or without an exception.
 * The <code>WorkManager</code> catches any exception thrown during 
 * <code>Work</code> processing (which includes execution context setup), 
 * and wraps it with a <code>WorkCompletedException</code>. </li>
 * </ul>
