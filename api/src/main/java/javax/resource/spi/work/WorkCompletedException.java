/**
 * This exception is thrown by a <code>WorkManager</code> to indicate that
 * a submitted <code>Work</code> instance has completed with an exception.
 *
 * <p>This could be thrown only after the execution of a
 * <code>Work</code> instance has started (that is, after a thread has
 * been allocated for <code>Work</code> execution). The allocated thread sets
 * up an execution context (if it has been specified), and then calls 
 * <code>Work.run()</code>.
 *
 * <p>Any exception thrown during execution context setup or during
 * <code>Work</code> execution (that is, during <code>Work.run()</code>) is
 * chained within this exception. 
 *
 * <p>An associated error code indicates the nature of the error condition.
 * Possible error codes are <code>WorkException.TX_RECREATE_FAILED</code>,
 * <code>WorkException.TX_CONCURRENT_WORK_DISALLOWED</code> or 
 * <code>WorkException.UNDEFINED</code>.
