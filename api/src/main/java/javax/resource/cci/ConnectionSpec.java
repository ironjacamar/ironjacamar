/** ConnectionSpec is used by an application component to pass 
 *  connection request-specific properties to the ConnectionFactory.
 *  getConnection method.
 *
 *  <p>It is recommended that the ConnectionSpec interface be 
 *  implemented as a JavaBean to support tools. The properties 
 *  on the ConnectionSpec implementation class must be defined 
 *  through the getter and setter methods pattern. 
 *  
 *  <p>The CCI specification defines a set of standard properties 
 *  for an ConnectionSpec. The properties are defined either on
 *  a derived interface or an implementation class of an empty
 *  ConnectionSpec interface. In addition, a resource adapter may 
 *  define additional properties specific to its underlying EIS.
