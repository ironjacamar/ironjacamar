/** The <code>javax.resource.cci.Interaction</code> enables a component to 
 *  execute EIS functions. An Interaction instance supports the following ways 
 *  of interacting with an EIS instance:
 *  <UL>
 *     <LI><code>execute</code> method that takes an input Record, output
 *         Record and an InteractionSpec. This method executes the EIS 
 *         function represented by the InteractionSpec and updates the 
 *         output Record
 *     <LI><code>execute</code> method that takes an input Record and an 
 *         InteractionSpec. This method implementation executes the EIS 
 *         function represented by the InteractionSpec and produces the 
 *         output Record as a return value.
 *  </UL>
 *  <p>An Interaction instance is created from a Connection and is required
 *  to maintain its association with the Connection instance. The close method
 *  releases all resources maintained by the resource adapter for the 
 *  Interaction. The close of an Interaction instance should not close the 
 *  associated Connection instance.
