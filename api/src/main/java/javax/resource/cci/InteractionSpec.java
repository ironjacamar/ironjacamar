/** An InteractionSpec holds properties for driving an Interaction 
 *  with an EIS instance. An InteractionSpec is used by an Interaction
 *  to execute the specified function on an underlying EIS.
 *
 *  <p>The CCI specification defines a set of standard properties for
 *  an InteractionSpec. An InteractionSpec implementation is not 
 *  required to support a standard property if that property does 
 *  not apply to its underlying EIS.
 *
 *  <p>The InteractionSpec implementation class must provide getter and
 *  setter methods for each of its supported properties. The getter and 
 *  setter methods convention should be based on the Java Beans design
 *  pattern.
 * 
 *  <p>The standard properties are as follows:
 *  <UL>
 *     <LI>FunctionName: name of an EIS function
 *     <LI>InteractionVerb: mode of interaction with an EIS instance:
 *         SYNC_SEND, SYNC_SEND_RECEIVE, SYNC_RECEIVE
 *     <LI>ExecutionTimeout: the number of milliseconds an Interaction 
 *         will wait for an EIS to execute the specified function
 *  </UL>
 *  
 *  <p>The following standard properties are used to give hints to an 
 *  Interaction instance about the ResultSet requirements:
 *  <UL>
 *     <LI>FetchSize
 *     <LI>FetchDirection
 *     <LI>MaxFieldSize
 *     <LI>ResultSetType
 *     <LI>ResultSetConcurrency
 *  </UL>
 *
 *  <p>A CCI implementation can provide additional properties beyond
 *  that described in the InteractionSpec interface. Note that the 
 *  format and type of the additional properties is specific to an EIS 
 *  and is outside the scope of the CCI specification.
 *  
 *  <p>It is required that the InteractionSpec interface be implemented
 *  as a JavaBean for the toolability support. The properties on the 
 *  InteractionSpec implementation class should be defined through the 
 *  getter and setter methods pattern. An implementation class for 
 *  InteractionSpec interface is  required to implement the 
 *  java.io.Serializable interface.
